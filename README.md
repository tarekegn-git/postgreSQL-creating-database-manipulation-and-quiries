# PostgreSQL Database Creation and Queries

## üöÄ About This Project
Welcome to my PostgreSQL project! In this PostgreSQL project, I will create a database named `merkato_market` which contains four tables such as `products, customers, product_categories
and orders`. Merkato market in Addis Ababa has hundreds of various items sold and bought by customers. The products table contains information 
about those items. Each product is categorized under the `product_categories` table, which contains information about product categories. For example, Teff and laptop are evidently under different categories. Finally, the `orders` table contains orders(selling and buying) by merkato customers, which means merchants from all over Ethiopia. After creating the database, I will conduct some queries to demonstrate the application of PostgreSQL for getting insights into the database. 

## üìå Creating Merkato Market Database 

```sql

CREATE DATABASE merkato_market

```
